# GV tap for homebrew

## How do I install this formula?
`brew install denismm/gv/gv`

Theoretically you should be able to tap it and then `brew install gv` but that has not worked for me, even after pinning this tap.

Or install via URL (which will not receive updates):

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denismm/homebrew-gv/master/Formula/gv%403.7.4.rb
```

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
