# GV tap for homebrew

I did the bare minimum of work to get this functional, not promising any updates.

Install XQuartz from https://www.xquartz.org/ before attempting this install.

## How do I install this formula?

`brew install denismm/gv/gv`

Or `brew tap denismm/gv` and then `brew install gv`.

Or install via URL (which will not receive updates):

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denismm/homebrew-gv/master/Formula/gv%403.7.4.rb
```

If you have problems with ghostscript, try pinning this tap first so you'll get the version of ghostscript with x11 options.

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
